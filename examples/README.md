# DeepSecure SDK Examples

Welcome to the DeepSecure SDK examples! These examples demonstrate how to integrate effortlessly secure identity and auth into your AI agent applications using the DeepSecure platform.

## 🎯 Purpose & Target Audience

These examples are designed for **AI developers and engineers** who want to:
- Learn how to secure their AI agents with verifiable identity, short lived credentials, and dynamic auth
- Integrate DeepSecure with popular frameworks like CrewAI and LangChain
- Understand best practices for agent identity and auth
- Get up and running quickly with minimal setup

**Perfect for**: Developers new to DeepSecure, teams evaluating agentic security solutions, anyone building multi-agent systems

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.9+** installed
2. **Docker** installed and running
3. **DeepSecure package** installed: `pip install deepsecure`

### Setup Steps
```bash
# 1. Start the DeepSecure backend services (Skip if you've already followed the main README)
docker compose up deeptrail-control deeptrail-gateway -d

# 2. Verify both services are running (Skip if you've already verified this)
curl http://localhost:8000/health  # Control plane
curl http://localhost:8002/health  # Gateway

# 3. Configure DeepSecure CLI for dual-service architecture
deepsecure configure set-url http://localhost:8000
deepsecure configure set-gateway-url http://localhost:8002
deepsecure configure set-token  # Use: DEFAULT_QUICKSTART_TOKEN

# 4. Set environment variables (alternative to CLI configuration)
export DEEPSECURE_DEEPTRAIL_CONTROL_URL=http://localhost:8000
export DEEPSECURE_GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:8002
export DEEPSECURE_DEEPTRAIL_CONTROL_API_TOKEN=DEFAULT_QUICKSTART_TOKEN

# 5. Install framework dependencies (for examples 3-6)
pip install 'deepsecure[frameworks]'

# 6. Store test secrets for gateway-proxied API calls
deepsecure vault store example-api-key --value "demo-api-key-12345"
deepsecure vault store openai-api-key --value "sk-demo-openai-key"
deepsecure vault store notion-api-key --value "secret_demo-notion-key"
deepsecure vault store tavily-api-key --value "tvly-demo-tavily-key"
```

**Why Steps 1-2**: These ensure both DeepSecure backend services are running:
- **Control Plane** (`deeptrail-control`): Handles agent identity, authentication, and policies
- **Gateway** (`deeptrail-gateway`): Proxies external API calls with automatic secret injection

**Why Steps 3-4**: The CLI and SDK need to know where both services are running. The gateway enables secure external API calls with automatic secret injection. This is a one-time setup per environment.

**Why Step 5**: Framework dependencies (CrewAI, LangChain) are optional but needed for examples 03-06. Installing `deepsecure[frameworks]` gets everything at once.

**Why Step 6**: These secrets will be automatically injected by the gateway when your agents make external API calls. The gateway handles the secure injection based on agent identity and policies.

**Ready to go!** Now you can run any example below.

## 🌐 Gateway Architecture & Real API Calls

All examples demonstrate **real external API calls** through the DeepSecure gateway. Here's how it works:

### 🔄 How Gateway Routing Works

1. **Agent Makes Request**: Your agent code makes an API call (e.g., to OpenAI)
2. **Gateway Intercepts**: The call is routed through `deeptrail-gateway:8002`
3. **Authentication**: Gateway validates the agent's JWT token
4. **Secret Injection**: Gateway automatically injects the appropriate API key
5. **Policy Enforcement**: Gateway checks agent policies before allowing the call
6. **API Call**: Gateway makes the actual call to the external service
7. **Response**: Gateway returns the response to your agent

### 🔐 Security Benefits You'll See

- **Zero API Key Exposure**: Your agents never see the actual API keys
- **Automatic Secret Rotation**: Gateway handles key rotation without agent changes
- **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Different agents can have different API access levels
- **Complete Audit Trail**: All external API calls are logged with agent identity
- **Policy Enforcement**: Real-time access control based on agent identity

### 🚀 What Makes These Examples Special

Unlike traditional examples that use hardcoded API keys:

- **No API Keys in Code**: All secrets are injected automatically
- **Real External Calls**: Examples make actual HTTP requests to external services
- **Production-Ready Patterns**: Shows how to build secure agents from day one
- **Scalable Architecture**: Same pattern works for 1 agent or 1000 agents
